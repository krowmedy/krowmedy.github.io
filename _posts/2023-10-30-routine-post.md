Today has been a bit of a waste for some reason, even though I went to the gym and slept well. I therefore decided to see if writing would somehow make me feel better. Spoiler alert: it didn't.

* I have been thinking about how everyone is affected by comparisons. It's a common enough thing to say: _"Don't compare yourself to others"_. But even comparing yourself to _yourself_  isn't always the best thing. For example, I was a pretty strong runner as compared to what I am today. But should I wallow-for and grasp-at that thing that I no longer am?

* On the other hand comparisons aren't all bad either. Many times inspiration and satisfaction can be derived with the help of comparison. Someone else's story might inspire you to take action since you may find that both of you are in comparatively similar situations. Similarly seeing yourself improve at a certain task provides satisfaction, and is a comparative exercise done over time.

* Other people's critique or adulation works in a similar manner. When people say _"Don't worry about what other people think"_, they usually mean _"other people's critiques"_. This too has its duality.

* If you completely shut off other people, their critiques may not hurt you, but neither will you let their appreciation in. Being human, both appreciation and criticism affects us. Criticism can result in self doubt, but may also shine a light on weaknesses and help in improvement. Appreciation may result in satisfaction, but too much of it could make you blind to your shortcomings. Shutting down what others think completely is quite hard if not impossible. But it's worthwhile to pay attention to some more than others.

* For example, I do recommend completely ignoring how strangers perceive you while walking down the street or in a public place.
