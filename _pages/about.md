Hi I am Rohit. I live in [Edinburgh](https://goo.gl/maps/t4zU45Pz7quYuzqFA). Previously I have lived in India and then the United States. I am a software engineer during the day, and a sleepy dad during the night. I have been in the tech industry for over 15 years. I got interested in Computer Science through video games (that I used to play a lot when I was young). I “learned” C++ when I was in 8th grade, and then C in 9th grade. Ever since that CS has been a constant part of my life. I actually like programming and building things, but programming isn’t the only hobby I have.

My current interests include Chess, that I [“stream” on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@chessforhumans). I am also learning how to drive in the UK (though I have previously driven in both India and United States). I can claim to be an intermediate level guitar player. I can play the Ukelele, but it’s really just a smaller guitar (no offense). I am thinking of learning to play the [Penny Whistle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whistle), but we’ll see. 

I like all sorts of sports. Like any other Indian kid, I played cricket obsessively. I can play badminton, and table tennis. I learned how to play [Ultimate Frisbee](https://www.catchthespirit.co.uk/ultimate) in the US, which I quite love. I also like to engage in endurance sports like cycling and running (though I have greatly reduced the distances that I used to once be able to do). 

Other than that I like the usual: reading, writing, watching The Office repeatedly, and trying out other silly things.

This website is about all of that. Hope you find something useful here. Enjoy!
